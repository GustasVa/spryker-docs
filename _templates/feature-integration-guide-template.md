# {title} ({Feature Name feature integration})

This document describes how to integrate the [Feature Name](link to a respective feature overview page) feature into a Spryker project.

## Install feature core

Follow the steps below to install the {Feature Name} feature core.

### Prerequisites
[comment]: <> "Describe the required other features \(if any\) with a version that should be in place before the current feature can be installed."

To start feature integration, overview, and install the necessary features:
[comment]: <> "Refer to feature mapping: https://release.spryker.com/features."

| NAME | VERSION |
| --------- | ------ |
| {Feature Name} | feature version |

### 1) Install required modules using Ð¡omposer
[comment]: <> "Provide the console command\(s\) with the exact latest version numbers of all required modules. If you have other modules except for the feature modules in the composer command, you need to move them to the prerequisites."

Run the following command(s) to install the required modules:

```
command to install the required modules
```

#### Verification
[comment]: <> "Provide the verification steps how to confirm that the step was performed correctly."
Make sure that the following modules have been installed:

| MODULE  | EXPECTED DIRECTORY |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| {ModuleName} | path for a directory (example: vendor/spryker/product-configuration) |

### 2) Set up the configuration
[comment]: <> "Provide config change list for altering config \(both system config or module config\). This is only necessary if it is mandatory to change the configuration. When the default configuration is enough for primary behavior, this step can be skipped."

Add the following configuration to your project:

| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
|example configuration | example specification|example namespace |

```
code sample with the updated configuration
```

#### Verification
[comment]: <> "Provide the verification steps how to confirm that the step was performed correctly."





### 3) Set up database schema and transfer objects
[comment]: <> "\(Optional\) Provide "code snippet\(s\)" with DB schema modifications that customers need to add to project code. \(Optional\) Provide code snippet\(s\) with transfer schema modifications that customers need to add to project code.\(Optional\) Provide "info" prior to each code snippet\(s\) explaining the purpose of these changes. Provide the console command\(s\) customers need to run to apply the changes \(in project + core\). "

Set up database schema and transfer objects as follows:
1.
2.

Apply database changes and generate entity and transfer changes:

```bash
console transfer:generate
console propel:install
console transfer:generate
```

#### Verification
[comment]: <> "Provide the verification steps how to confirm that the step was performed correctly."

Make sure that the following changes have been applied by checking your database:

| Database Entity | Type | Event |
| --------------- | ---- | ------ |
| sample entity | table | sample event |

Make sure that the following changes have been triggered in transfer objects:

| Transfer  | Type  | Event   | Path   |
| ---------- | ---- | ------ | -------------- |
| example transer | class | example event | example path   |



### 4) Set up database schema
[comment]: <> "This step is only possible if your feature has no transfer object definition changes. \(Optional\) Provide code snippet\(s\) with DB schema modifications that customers need to add to project code. \(Optional\) Provide "info" prior to each code snippet\(s\)  explaining the purpose of these changes. Provide the console command\(s\) customers need to run to apply the changes \(in project + core\). "

Adjust the schema definition so entity changes will trigger events.

| ------------- | ----------- |
| example entity | example event |

```
example code of the database schema
```

Run the following commands to apply database changes and generate entity and transfer changes:

```

console propel:install
console transfer:generate
```

#### Verification
[comment]: <> "Provide the verification steps how to confirm that the step was performed correctly."

Make sure that the following changes have been applied by checking your database:

| --------------- | ---- | ----- |
| example entity   | table | example event |


### 5) Set up transfer objects
[comment]: <> "This step is only possible if your feature has no database definition changes. \(Optional\) Provide code snippet\(s\) with transfer schema modifications that customers need to add to project code. \(Optional\) Provide "info" prior to each code snippet\(s\) explaining the purpose of these changes. Provide the console command\(s\) customers need to run to apply the changes \(in project + core\)."

| Plugin | Specification | Prerequisites | Namespace   |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| example plugin | Description | None  | example namespace |

```
code snippet
```


### 8) Configure export to Redis
[comment]: <> "This step is only possible if your feature has no elasitcsearch configuration changes. Provide a plugin list for wiring Pub & Sync up. Provide a plugin list for enabling Re-generate and Re-sync features of Pub & Sync."

This step will publish tables on change (create, edit, delete) to the \<table_name\> and synchronize the data to Storage.
