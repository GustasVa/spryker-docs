In the *Merchants* page, you can manage the merchants' records and facilitate the merchant registration and approval process, as well as apply any changes to the existing merchants' records. This topic describes the procedures of creating and managing merchant records.

To start managing merchants, navigate to the *Marketplace* > *Merchants* section.

## Creating merchants

To **create a merchant**, do the following:

1. On the Merchants page, click **+Add Merchant** in the top right corner.
2. Fill in the required information. See [Merchants: reference information](/docs/marketplace/user/back-office-user-guides/merchants/merchants-reference-information.html) for details on the attributes you can add.
3. Click **Save**.

## Editing merchants

To **edit a merchant**, do the following:

1. On the *Merchants* page, in the *Actions* column click **Edit** for a merchant you want to edit.
2. On the *Edit Merchant* page, edit the merchant details. See [Merchants: reference information](/docs/marketplace/user/back-office-user-guides/merchants/merchants-reference-information.html) on the attributes you can update.
3. To save the changes, click **Save**.

## Approving and denying merchants

Merchant approval is the process when a Marketplace Administrator changes the status of the merchant record according to the flow described in the [Merchant statuses](/docs/marketplace/user/features/merchants/merchants-feature-overview.html#merchant-statuses) section. After the initial merchant registration, the status is always set to **Waiting for Approval** and is subject to change by a Marketplace Administrator after their review. To approve the merchant, click **Approve Access** in the *Actions* column of the *Merchants* page.

## (De)Activating merchants

Activating or deactivating the merchant indicates whether the merchant profile page, product offers, and merchant products are available in the Storefront or not. To activate the merchant, click **Activate** in the *Actions* column of the *Merchants* page.

{% include note.html content="You can deactivate the merchant by clicking Deactivate on the Merchants page, in the Actions column." %}

**What's next?**

Once you have the merchant record available in the system, you can proceed with creating a merchant user to be able to log in to the Merchant Portal.

See the [Managing merchant users](/docs/marketplace/user/back-office-user-guides/merchants/managing-merchant-users.html) article to know how you create those.
