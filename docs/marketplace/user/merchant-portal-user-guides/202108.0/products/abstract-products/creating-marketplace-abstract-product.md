This document describes how to create a merchant abstract product.

## Prerequisites

To start working with merchant abstract products, go to **Merchant Portal > Products**.

Review the reference information before you start, or just look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Creating a marketplace abstract product

To create a new abstract product:

1. On the *Products* page, click **Create Product**. *Create Abstract Product* drawer opens.

2. Define the following settings:

   1. Enter an **SKU Prefix**.

   2. Enter a **Name** for the default locale. The rest of the locales will be defined once the product is created.

   3. Select **Abstract product has 1 concrete product** if you are creating an abstract product that doesn't require variants. *Create an Abstract Product with 1 Concrete Product* drawer opens.

   {% info_block warningBox "Warning" %}

   It is not possible to save the abstract product unless it is accompanied by at least one concrete product.

   {% endinfo_block %}

   
   Select **Abstract product has multiple concrete products** if the abstract product you are creating will require variants.

   1. Click **Next**. </br>

   </br>

      If the **Abstract product has 1 concrete product** was chosen:</br>


      1. On the *Create an Abstract Product with 1 Concrete Product* drawer, enter a **Concrete Product SKU**.
      2. Enter a **Concrete Product Name**.
      3. Click **Create** to finish the product creation.

      If the **Abstract product has multiple concrete products** was chosen:</br>

   </br>

      1. Select a super attribute that defines the variation of your concrete products.
      2. In the field next to the super attribute you've selected, select one or more values for each super attribute. Upon adding the super attribute values, the preview of the concrete products will be displayed.
    
      {% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
    
      Removing a super attribute or its value will remove the appropriate concrete product(s) or concrete product values from the preview.
    
      {% endinfo_block %}
    
      1. (Optional) Add more super attributes by clicking the **Add** button. Repeat this step until you select at least one value for each selected super attribute.

      **Tips and Tricks** </br>

      You can remove a concrete product from the preview list by clicking the **Remove** icon.

3. Once done, click **Create**.

**Tips and Tricks** </br>

To return to the previous step, click **Back**.

Once the product is created, it needs to be [activated by the Marketplace administrator in the Back Office](/docs/marketplace/user/back-office-user-guides/{{ page.version }}/catalog/products/managing-products/managing-products.html#activating-a-product). Only the active marketplace products are displayed in the Merchant Portal and Marketplace Storefront.

You can select as many super attributes as you need and define one or more values for them. When you select a product attribute value, a concrete product based on this value is displayed. In the *Concrete Productsâ€™ Preview* pane you can view the products to be created.

By selecting **Autogenerate SKUs**, the SKU numbers for the variants are generated automatically, based on the SKU prefix of their abstract product.

By selecting **Same Name as Abstract Product**, the name of the abstract product is used for the concrete products as well.
