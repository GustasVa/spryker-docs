Marketplace Shipment feature allows to dispatch the marketplace order into several shipments





Every merchant order has its own shipment and delivery method based on the merchantâ€™s setup. However, a customer can customize the delivery settings at the **Address** step of the checkout and, for example, split one merchant order into several shipments if needed. See [Split Delivery feature overview](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/split-delivery-overview) for details.
