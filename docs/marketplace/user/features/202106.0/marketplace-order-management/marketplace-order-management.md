When customer places an order on the Marketplace, the *Marketplace order* is created. The Marketplace order can contain offers and products from different merchants. The part of the order that belongs to a certain merchant is referred to as *merchant order*. The merchant order is created in the system after the Marketplace order has been placed.

Marketplace administrators can view and manage Marketplace orders in the Back Office. Merchants can access and manage only their orders in the Merchant Portal.
