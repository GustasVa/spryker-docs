Wishlists are collections of products that a customer saves for further reference. 

Marketplace Wishlist feature allows customers to add product offers and merchant products to a wishlist in the Marketplace Storefront. This way customers save time without the need of browsing favorite items all over the marketplace shop.

Merchant information is displayed in the *Sold by* field so that customer can always know which merchant is the owner of the product. 

Once the customer is committed to a purchase of a product, they can add it to cart directly from the wishlist.
