*Merchants* belong to the main Marketplace actors as they are the sellers of products and services. As the third-party sellers, so also marketplace administrators can be merchants.

Merchants are created and managed by marketplace administrators in the Back Office. 

Merchants, in their turn, can manage their business and information in the Merchant Portal. Merchants employees who have access to the Merchant Portal and can perform actions on behalf of the merchants, are referred to as *merchant users*.
