With the Marketplace shipment feature, the [marketplace orders](/docs/marketplace/dev/feature-walkthroughs/{{ page.version }}/marketplace-order-management-feature-walkthrough.html) are split into several shipments based on the merchants from which the items were bought. Merchants can see their shipments only.

To learn more about the feature and to find out how end users use it, see [Marketplace Shipment](/docs/marketplace/user/features/{{ page.version }}/marketplace-shipment-feature-overview.html) feature overview for business users.
