## Warehouse management
You can manage the relations between merchant and warehouse by importing the warehouse and merchant data. See [File details: merchant_stock.csv](/docs/marketplace/dev/data-import/{{ page.version }}/file-details-merchant-stock-csv.html)

## Stock management
You can manage the stock of product offers for a merchant by importing the product offer and stock data separately. See [File details: product_offer_stock.csv](/docs/marketplace/dev/data-import/{{ page.version }}/file-details-product-offer-stock-csv.html). Or you can define stock when importing the product offer data. See [File details: combined_merchant_product_offer.csv](/docs/marketplace/dev/data-import/202108.0/file-details-combined-merchant-product-offer-csv.html)
