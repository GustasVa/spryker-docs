Merchant Oms enables a dedicated Oms flow for Merchant Orders and its Merchants.

Merchant Oms has no direct communication channel with plain Oms.
Usually the state synchronization between an Order and a Merchant Order happens by listening events and running commands on them.

The following diagram shows an example of how Oms and Merchant Oms can interact.

The feature also allows assigning different Oms flows to different Merchants.
This might be useful if you have some enterprise Merchants on your Marketplace and want to enable different business models on your Marketplace.
