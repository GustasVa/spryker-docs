The [BazzarVoice](https://www.bazaarvoice.com/) app lets you collect and add user-generated content (UGC) to your product pages. 

The BazzarVoice service offers the following UGC: 

- [Rating summaries](https://knowledge.bazaarvoice.com/wp-content/conversations/en_US/Display/display_integration.html#rating-summary) (stars)
- [Product reviews](https://knowledge.bazaarvoice.com/wp-content/conversations/en_US/Display/display_integration.html#reviews)  
- [Questions and answers](https://knowledge.bazaarvoice.com/wp-content/conversations/en_US/Display/display_integration.html#questions--answers)

BazzarVoice uses the content syndication approach, which means that stores using BazzarVoice republish each others' content. For example, if a store within the BazzarVoice's network has got a new product review, this review is shared across all other stores in the network that also have this product.

To enable BazzarVoice match your products to products in other stores and upload product reviews into your store, you must use UPCs or EANs as unique identifiers for your products.
