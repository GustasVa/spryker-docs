A deployment fails and there are no errors in the deploy or build output. Based on the step the deployment fails at, do the following:


## Deployment fails at the Build_Push_if_not_exist step

If a deployment fails at the `Build_Push_if_not_exist`, do the following.

{% include searching-by-logs.md %} <!-- To edit, see /_includes/searching-by-logs.md -->

### 2. Check deploy logs in multiple log groups at once

Check multiple log groups via Logs Insights as follows. Select the log groups containing `codebuild`.

{% include searching-by-multiple-log-groups.md %} <!-- To edit, see /_includes/searching-by-multiple-log-groups.md -->

### 3. Check Build_Push_if_not_exist step execution details

1. On the page of the deployment in the `Build_Push_if_not_exist` step, select **Details**.
