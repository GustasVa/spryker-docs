Performance testing is a central part of your development and deployment process. While you consider performance during your development already, it is essential to test the performance of your code on the staging environment before deploying your code to production environments. Note that performance tests should be conducted with real data in the same quantity as the data that your code will need to handle and work with on the production environment. Testing with real or even mock data gives you significantly better and and more reliable results than extrapolating from a small data set.

From our experience, the [Load testing tool](https://github.com/spryker-sdk/load-testing) can help you load test better  

We can offer [test data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QvwDp2wGz6C4aqGI1O9nK7G9Q_U8UUS-?usp=sharing) for an expanding amount of use cases in this repository that you are invited to use if you cannot use real data in staging environments or are having problems producing mock-ups of data yourself. Note that we do not provide support for these files per se, but you can [let us know](https://spryker.force.com/support/s/knowledge-center) if you require different data, and we will try to accommodate.
