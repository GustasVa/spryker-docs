This article describes how to manage merchant relations.
To start working with merchant relations, go to **Marketplace&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Merchant Relations**.

## Prerequisites

To be able to create a merchant relation, you need to have a fully set up company account in the **Company Account** section as the company data drives from there.

## Create a merchant relation

To create a merchant relation:
1. On the **Overview of Merchant relation** page, click **Add Merchant relation**.
2. On the **Create Merchant Relation** page, select a **MERCHANT**.
3. Select a **COMPANY**.
4. Click **Confirm**.
5. Select a **BUSINESS UNIT OWNER**.
6. Optional: Enter and select one or more **ASSIGNED BUSINESS UNITS**.
7. Optional: Enter and select one or more **ASSIGNED PRODUCT LISTS**.
5. Click **Save**.

The merchant is created and can be used to create merchant specific prices (see [Creating abstract products and product bundles](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/catalog/products/manage-abstract-products/creating-abstract-products-and-product-bundles.html) and [Creating a product variant](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/catalog/products/manage-concrete-products/creating-product-variants.html) to know more). As well as they can be used to create merchant relationship thresholds (see [Managing merchant order thresholds](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/administration/thresholds/managing-merchant-order-thresholds.html) for more details).
