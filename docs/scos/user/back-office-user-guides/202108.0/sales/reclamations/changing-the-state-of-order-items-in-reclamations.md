This document describes how to change the state of order items in reclamations. Each reclamation is linked to the order it was created from. When you change the state of an order in a reclamation, you change it in the linked order.

## Prerequisites

To start working with reclamations, go to **Sales** > **Reclamations**.

The instructions assume that there is an existing order with the **Payment pending** status.

Review the [reference information](#reference-information-changing-the-state-of-order-items) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.
