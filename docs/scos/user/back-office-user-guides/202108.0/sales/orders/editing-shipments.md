## Prerequisites

To start working with order shipments, do the following:
1. Go to **Sales** > **Orders**.
2. Next to the order you want to manage the shipment of, click **View**.
    This opens the **Order Overview** page.

Review the [reference information](#reference-information-editing-shipments) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

If you create or edit a shipment of an order created by a customer, the grand total paid by the customer is not affected:
* If a new shipment method is added, its price is 0.
* If the shipment method is changed, the price of the previous shipment method is displayed.

{% endinfo_block %}





## Editing shipments

1. In the **ORDER ITEMS** section, next to the shipment you want to edit, click **Edit Shipment**.
    This opens the **Create Shipment** page.
