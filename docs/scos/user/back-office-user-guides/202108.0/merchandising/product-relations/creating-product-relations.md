This document describes how to create product relations in the Back Office.

## Prerequisites

To start working with product relations, go to **Merchandising** > **Product Relations**.

## Creating product relations

To create a product relation:
1. On the **Product Relations** page, click **Create Product Relation**.
    The **Create Product Relation** page opens.
2. Enter a **PRODUCT RELATION KEY**.
3. Select a **RELATION TYPE**.
4. For the related products to be updated automatically on a regular basis according to the product relation's rules, select the **UPDATE REGULARLY** checkbox.
5. To activate the product relation after creating it, select the **IS ACTIVE** checkbox.
6. In the **Product owning the relation** pane, next to the product you want to create a product relation with, click **Select**.

7. In the **Store relation** pane, select the stores you want the product relation to be displayed in.

8. Ð¡lick **Next**.

6. Click **Add rule** or **Add group**, depending on the conditions you want to specify. To learn more about rules, see [Related product rules](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-relations-feature-overview.html#related-product-rules).  

7. For the rule/group, select the operator:
    * **AND**: the selected products are displayed if all the specified conditions are fulfilled
    * **OR**: the selected products are displayed if at least one of the specified conditions is fulfilled

8. Populate the required drop-downs and fields for the rule/group.

9. To keep the changes, click **Save**. The table is automatically updated to display the abstract product that fulfills the specified rules/groups.

**Tips and tricks**

* If you want a product relation to be displayed on the *Product details* page or the *Cart* page, define at least one **Store relation**.
* Filter the products in the *Select product* table by entering a product name or SKU in the **Search** field.
* You can delete a rule or group by clicking **Delete** for a specific entry.
* Go back to the *Product Relation* page by clicking **List of product relations** in the top right corner.
