## Prerequisites

* Optional: To select billing and shipping addresses, [add customer addresses](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/customer/customers/add-customer-addresses.html).


## Edit a customer


1. For a specific customer, you need to update, click **Edit** in the _Actions_ column on the *Customers* page.
2. On the *Edit Customer* page, you see the same attributes as on the *Add a customer* page, but with the following exceptions:
    *  The *Email* field is greyed out and is not available for updates.
    *  You see two additional drop-down lists: **Billing Address** and **Shipping Address**. The values in those fields appear only if the addresses were added to the customer profile on the Storefront or from the **Back Office&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> View** customer-specific page. Those are not available for modifications from the *Edit Customer* page.
3. Update the needed values and click **Save**.

**Tips and tricks**
<br>From the *Edit customer* page, you can:
* Switch to the *View* customer page, where you can manage the addresses by adding a new address or updating the existing one (see the _Viewing Customer Details_ section below).
* Delete the customer record (see the _Deleting a Customer Record_ section below).
