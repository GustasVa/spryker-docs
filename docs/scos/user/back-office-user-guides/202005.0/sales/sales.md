The **Sales** section in Back Office is mostly used by the Sales Department.
This section is designed to manage the orders. Understanding how sales orders work is an important part of running a shop, as the entire business depends on how efficiently the orders that customers make in your shop can be managed. This section stores information about all orders made by the customers, the refunds, and reclamations. You can also find the reclamations there. 


In this section you see the following:
* Order Matrix
* Orders
* Reclamations
* Returns
* Refunds
* Gift Card Balance
