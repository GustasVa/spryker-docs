This topic describes how to manage warehouses.

## Prerequisites

To start working with warehouses, go to **Administration** > **Warehouses**.

Review the [reference information](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/creating-a-warehouse#reference-information--creating-warehouses) before you start, or just look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Viewing warehouse details

To view the warehouse details:

1. In the *Actions* column, click **View** for the warehouse you want to view. This takes you to the *View Warehouse: [Warehouse name]* page. 
2. On the *View Warehouse: [Warehouse name]* page, the following information is available:
    * warehouse name
    * status: whether the warehouse is available or not
    * store(s) in which the warehouse is available


## Editing warehouse details

To edit the warehouse details:

1. In the *Actions* column, click **Edit** for the warehouse you want to update. This takes you to the *Edit Warehouse: [Warehouse name]* page. 
2. In the *Configuration* tab, make changes to the needed attributes.
3. Switch to the **Store relation** tab and specify the store in which you want the warehouse to be available.
4. To keep the changes, click **Save**. This redirects you to the *Warehouses* page, where you can see the updated warehouse and the following message: 'Warehouse has been successfully updated'.
