This article describes how to create product bundles. 

With the Product Bundles feature, you can freely tie individual items together and sell them as a package. As opposed to a set in which products are loosely grouped, the items in a bundle are always sold together. You can choose to create a special bundle price to make the purchase more attractive.
You need bundles to simplify the user journey. When they want to buy something together, it is easier to make it once than to go to the product details page for each separate item and add it to the cart separately.
For example, if your product is a smartphone, you can set it up to be sold with a smart card and case.

## Prerequisites

To start creating product bundles, navigate to **Catalog** > **Products**.

## Creating product bundles

To create a product bundle:
1. Click **+Create Bundle Product**.
2. On the *Create a Product* page, do the procedure described in [Creating an Abstract Product](/docs/scos/user/user-guides/{{page.version}}/back-office-user-guide/catalog/products/abstract-products/creating-abstract-products-and-product-bundles.html).
3. Populate the *General*, *Price & Tax*, *SEO*, and *Image* tabs.
4. Click **Save**.
    The only difference is that you do not define the product variants for the bundle.
    Only one variant is created **automatically** once you save the data.
5. On the Variants tab, click **Edit** in the _Actions_ column.
6. Populate the information similarly to how you do for the product variant.
7. In the *Assign bundled products* tab, define the product variants that are going to be included in the bundle by selecting the checkboxes in the _Select_ —Åolumn.
8. Click **Save**.


**Tips & tricks**
If you already have a product that you want to be sold in a bundle, you can update the *Assign bundled products* tab for a variant. The product will automatically be transformed into a bundle.

### Reference information: Creating product bundles

 This section provides an example of when you should create a product bundle.

Let's say you want to simplify the user journey and allow buying a bundle of products that are commonly used together (e.g., pens, notebooks, copy paper, and other stationery).
You create a bundle for that purpose.
