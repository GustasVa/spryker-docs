The topic describes how to create a carrier company.

To start working with the carrier companies, go to **Administration** > **Shipment** > **Delivery Methods**.
***
**To create a carrier company:**
1. In the top-right corner of the **Delivery Methods** page, click **Create new carrier company**.
2. On the **Create new Carrier company** page, enter a name for the carrier company:
{% info_block warningBox %}
 The name you enter will be visible on the **Create new delivery method** page only.
{% endinfo_block %}
4. To activate the carrier company, select the **Enabled?** checkbox.
5. To complete the creation, click **Add** .
{% info_block infoBox %}
Click **List of shipment methods**to get back to the list of delivery methods. However, clicking this option **prior to** saving the changes will discard all the changes and take you to the **Delivery Methods** page.
{% endinfo_block %}

***
**What's next?**
You have now added a new carrier company for your store.
The next step is to add a new shipment method to it. See [Creating and Managing Delivery Methods](/docs/scos/user/user-guides/{{page.version}}/back-office-user-guide/administration/delivery-methods/creating-and-managing-delivery-methods.html) for more details.
