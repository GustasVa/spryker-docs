# PHP 7

Since April 2022, Spryker requires **PHP 7.4** as the minimum version. We will keep supporting **PHP 7.4** until June 2022.

# PHP 8

Since October 2021, Spryker has been compatible with **PHP 8.0**. We recommend using **PHP 8.0** if possible. 
We plan to support **PHP 8.1** by the end of June 2022, using it remains optional for now.
