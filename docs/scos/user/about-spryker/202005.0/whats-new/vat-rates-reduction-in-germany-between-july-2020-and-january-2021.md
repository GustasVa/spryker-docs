On 3 June 2020, the German parliament proposed to temporarily reduce the VAT rates from 1 July 2020 until 31 December 2020.

*     Standard rate is to be reduced from 19% to 16%.
*     Reduced rate is to be reduced from 7% to 5%

If you need to adjust the VAT rate for your project accordingly, follow the guides:

* [Managing Tax Rates and Sets](/docs/scos/user/user-guides/202005.0/back-office-user-guide/administration/taxes/tax-rates-and-tax-sets/managing-tax-rates-and-sets.html) to update the tax rates manually in the Back Office.
* [HowTo - Get Ready for VAT (tax) Changes in Germany](/docs/scos/dev/tutorials/202005.0/howtos/howto-get-ready-for-vat-tax-changes-in-germany.html) to schedule the tax rates updates in code.
