Master Suite represents a collection of both [B2B](/docs/scos/user/about-spryker/202005.0/b2b-suite.html) and [B2C](/docs/scos/user/about-spryker/202005.0/b2c-suite.html) modules. However, unlike B2B and B2C Demo Shops, the code in the [Master Suite project repository](https://github.com/spryker-shop/suite) is released as soon as it is ready.  If you have an implementation that combines B2B and B2C, you can benefit from the full range of SCOS functionality. 

Or

If you want to take a single feature or module from the larger SCOS scope, you can take single modules  from the following GitHub repository paths:

[https://github.com/spryker-shop/*](https://github.com/spryker-shop/)
[https://github.com/spryker/*](https://github.com/spryker/)
