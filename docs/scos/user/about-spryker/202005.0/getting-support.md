If you need technical help for issues that can't be resolved with our documentation, you can always count on our support team.

Depending on the types of issues, there are two ways to report them and request support from us:

1. For **bug reports** and **product issues**, feel free to create a case for our support team at the [support portal](https://support.spryker.com).
2. For **security-related issues** please follow the instructions at [Security Support](/docs/scos/user/about-spryker/202005.0/handling-security-issues.html).
