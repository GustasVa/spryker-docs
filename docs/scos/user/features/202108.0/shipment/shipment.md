Choosing the best and effective strategy to ship products to your customers is an essential element for the success of your shop. With the *Shipment* feature, you can integrate several carrier companies and delivery methods and define their availability, as well as set  stores in which the delivery method will be available.

During the checkout process, your customers can easily select their preferred shipment method and related carrier. Your customers can also see which carrier offers which delivery method in their respective regions and select their preferences.

Shipment is the feature your shop will benefit from, as it allows you to:

* Set a huge range of delivery methods to choose from.

* Configure shipment carriers and customize existing delivery methods.

* Encourage your customers to make more purchases by setting flexible shipping discounts based on cart rules.
