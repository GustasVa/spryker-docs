Many customers prefer shopping based on shopping lists they created earlier. Either at the stage of the shopping lists compilation, or already after it, customers often have some thoughts, ideas or general remarks about individual products that they would want to consider in the future. They might want a reminder attached to particular shopping list items, for example, saying that prior to purchase it is necessary to make sure a product is not available in their stock, or check if even more of it should be bought. In this case, the Shopping List Notes feature comes in handy. This feature enables customers to add, edit and delete notes for individual items on the shopping lists. When a customer transfers shopping list items to cart, their notes are taken over to the cart as well, appearing as [cart notes](docs\scos\user\features\202009.0\cart\cart-feature-overview\cart-notes-overview.md) there.

The possibility to manage shopping list notes adds convenience for you customers, improves their shopping experience and therefore helps you gain more delighted customers and ultimately even increase sales.
