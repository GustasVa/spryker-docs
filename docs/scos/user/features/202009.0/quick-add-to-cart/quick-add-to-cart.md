Regular buyers, and especially B2B wholesale customers, often know what exactly they want to order from the shopâ€”by product SKU, product name, etc. The *Quick Add to Cart* feature enables your customers to find and buy products in just a few clicks. Instead of going to each product page individually, they can go to the *Quick Add to Cart* page, accessible directly from the header, and quickly order items by typing product SKU and its quantity in respective fields. At the same time, if some specific [quantity restrictions](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/non-splittable-products-feature-overview.html) apply to products, they will also be taken into account when ordering through the *Quick Add to Cart* page. The *Quick Add to Cart* form can also be used to add items to [shopping lists](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/shopping-lists-feature-overview/multiple-and-shared-shopping-lists/multiple-and-shared-shopping-lists.html). Also, if a customer has a list of products to be ordered, for example, in a .csv file or other, the ordering process becomes even faster. The customer can bulk add SKUs and put quantities next to them in a single field. This being done, the customer either adds the items to cart or proceeds directly to checkout.

Placing an order through the *Quick Add to Cart* page requires significantly less navigation. This adds convenience and saves time for your new and returning customers, encouraging them to come back and buy more.
