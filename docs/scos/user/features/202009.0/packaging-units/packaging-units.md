Some customers prefer to buy products in bulk, say, not just 40 apples, but a bag of 40 apples. This holds true for almost all B2B customers as well as for some B2C buyers. To meet these expectations, shop owners can offer products in different packaging units - items, bags, pallets, etc. The shop owner can define a list of packaging units per an abstract product. In addition, they can define if a packaging unit holds a fixed amount of products, or if a customer can buy any amount of products in this packaging unit.

With the Packaging Units feature in place, shop owners can apply some restrictions for products with packaging units. For example, a bag of apples can be limited to 40 apples, or no more/no less than 10 apples or the number of apples in the packaging unit can only be a multiple of 10. Also, you can share the stock between products in the packaging unit, if needed.

Besides the whole numbers, you can use decimal values for the amount and stock. For example, you can sell 12,5 kg of salmon and have the same value in the database, without converting it to an integer.

All this makes the Packaging Units feature indispensable for wholesale sellers and buyers:

* It adds convenience for other users who might occasionally want to buy big amounts of products.
* Due to the ease and convenience of use, it can even urge customers to buy more.
* Packaging Units can also be used in promotional campaigns (for instance, "buy a pallet of Coca Cola and get 1 bottle for free") to increase sales as well as help to save money for both seller and buyer (a package of cans might cost less than the same amount of cans sold separately).
* Defining stock as a decimal value allows you to represent the real amount of stock you have in the inventory.
The feature simplifies product management for customers and allows them to limit or set ranges of products sold in specific packaging units.
