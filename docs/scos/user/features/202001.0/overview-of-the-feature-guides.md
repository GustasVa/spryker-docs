The feature guides provide detailed descriptions of features, highlights their functional abilities, business values, and use-case examples. This information might be useful for: 
* Business owners
* Product owners
* Anyone looking to learn more about the Spryker features or add new functionality to a Spryker-based project

The *Features* section unfolds into a list of capabilities. Each capability contains a capability description and conceptual documentation of all features the capability includes.

In the feature documentation, you will find the following information:

* A short summary of a feature with lists of guidelines designed for different [personas](/docs/scos/user/about-spryker/202001.0/about-spryker-documentation.html#personas){target="_blank"}.
* A detailed overview of a feature, workflows, database structure, and more.
