In the context of Spryker B2B eCommerce platform, there can be three key figures: marketplace owner, merchant and buyer.

* The marketplace owner owns the platform and acts as a broker between merchants and buyers.
* The merchants are actually sellers usually represented by a company.
* The buyers are often business units of companies that purchase products or services from the merchants.

The business relationships between merchants and buyers are usually based on contracts.
