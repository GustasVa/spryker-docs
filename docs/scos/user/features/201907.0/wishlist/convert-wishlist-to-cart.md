The direct-to-cart function enables your customers to simply add items from their Wishlist to the Shopping Cart with a single click.

The customer can:

* add all the products from the wishlist to the cart by selecting the Add all available products to cart
![Wishlist Add all to cart](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Features/Wishlist/Convert+Wishlist+to+Cart/wishlist-all-to-cart.gif)

* add selected item from the wishlist to the cart by using the Add to Cart option for a specific item
![Wishlist Add one to cart](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Features/Wishlist/Convert+Wishlist+to+Cart/wishlist-add-one-to-cart.gif)

The Wishlist option works only for logged in customers.
