Spryker Commerce OS is shipped with an all-inclusive and fully pre-provisioned development environment on a virtual machine, based on Vagrant and VirtualBox. A Docker container-based environment is provided for development as an alternative to the virtual machine.
The command-line Console tool enables you to execute a great variety of commands, such as managing the Spryker Commerce OS installer, to run the OS in any environment.
