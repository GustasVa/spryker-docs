One of the best e-commerce techniques to drive your sales and reduce marketing spendings is a cross-selling and upselling techniques. To use them in Spryker, you can define product relations to recommend the desired products to your customers. For example, when your customers buy a phone, you can display headphones or a phone case as additional items to encourage customers to buy more. Additionally, you can display product associations that let your customers see the products they might also be interested in. To up-sell items, you can build a set of suggestions to offer upscale product versions or additional fixtures to maximize the cart value.

To summarize, the Product Relations feature brings a lot of benefits to shop owners, including:

* boosting sales
* improving customer experience by offering different products
* providing customers with more choices
* promoting the right products
* drawing the customers' attention to the goods that customers may also want to see
