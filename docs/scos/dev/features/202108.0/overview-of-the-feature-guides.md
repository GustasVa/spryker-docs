The feature guides describe features in details, highlight their functional abilities, business values, and use-case examples. This information might be useful for: 
* Business owners
* Product owners
* Anyone looking to learn more about the Spryker features or add new functionality to a Spryker-based project

The *Features* section is divided into capabilities. Each capability contains a capability description and conceptual documentation of all the features a capability includes.

In the feature documentation, you will find the following information:

* A short feature summary with guidelines designed for different [personas](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/{{site.version}}/about-spryker-documentation.html#personas){target="_blank"}.
* A detailed feature overview, workflows, database structure, and more.
