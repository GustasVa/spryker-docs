Enabling your customers to track and save the products they wish to purchase through a wish list function effectively reduces cart abandonment, boosts your sales and allows you to keep track of which products your customers are interested in. Allow your customers to create multiple wish lists and customize the name of a new list. With a direct-to-cart feature, customers can immediately add items from their wish list to the shopping cart.
