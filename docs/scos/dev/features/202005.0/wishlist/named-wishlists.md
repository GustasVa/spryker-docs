Users can easily keep track of their Wishlists by naming each one individually.

When the customer selects **Add to Wishlist** for the first time and there are no wishlists in the system yet, one will be created automatically with name **My Wishlist**.

The wishlist name can be later changed in the **Wishlist** section. As well as new wishlists can be added in the **Wishlist** section of the customer account.

For more information about multiple wishlists, see [Multiple Wishlists](/docs/scos/dev/features/202005.0/wishlist/multiple-wishlists.html).

Only logged in customers can use the Wishlist functionality.
