This section will help the developers to handle situations when a new feature requires an extensive migration effort for modules, or some technical solution used in Spryker needs to be replaced with a new one.

Here you will find instructions on how implement these changes in your project. The section includes the following parts:

* [Split Delivery Migration Concept](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/202005.0/migration-concepts/split-delivery-migration-concept.html): Contains general information about the Split Delivery feature and describes the steps to update all the affected modules in bulk.
* [Silex Replacement Migration Concept](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/202005.0/migration-concepts/silex-replacement/silex-replacement.html): Outlines the main changes to be applied in a project and concepts on how to migrate away from Silex to the Spryker Application replacing it.
