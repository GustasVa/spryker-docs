## Upgrading from Version 0.1.* to Version 0.3.0

{% info_block infoBox %}
In order to dismantle the Horizontal Barrier and enable partial module updates on projects, a Technical Release took place. Public API of source and target major versions are equal. No migration efforts are required. Please [contact us](https://spryker.com/en/support/) if you have any questions.
