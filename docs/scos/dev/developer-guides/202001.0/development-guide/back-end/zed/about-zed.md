Zed is one of the application layers of the Spryker Commerce OS, providing the backoffice/backend functionality.

See [Conceptual Overview](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202001.0/architecture-guide/conceptual-overview.html
{% endinfo_block %} to learn more about the Spryker applications and their layers.)

Zed is divided into three parts:

* Business layer, containing the entire business logic;
* Persistence layer, responsible for the database structure, connections to it, i.e., for the data persistence;
* Communication layer, enabling the connection to the external providers.
