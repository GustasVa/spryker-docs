Spryker allows you to change the modules included in a project at your will. You can add, remove, upgrade etc the modules a project consists of or even build a unique set of modules that suits specifically your needs. To do so:

1. Start with an existing Spryker, such as the B2C, B2B boilerplates or your own project based on Spryker Commerce OS.

2. Add or remove modules as necessary using [Composer](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202005.0/installation/composer.html). All available modules can be found in the following repositories:
