When you have completed the instructions on [front end](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202009.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/payment-methods/prepayment/implement-prepayment-in-front-end.html), [back end](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202009.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/payment-methods/prepayment/implementing-prepayment-in-back-end.html) and [shared](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202009.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/payment-methods/prepayment/implementing-prepayment-in-shared-layer.html) implementation, you are able to test the payment method you just implemented.

 This is the last step for this tutorial.

All you need to do is to submit a new order from Yves. After that you can control the flow of the order in Zed UI.
